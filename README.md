# Conways Game of Life

Conways Game is a cellular automata developed by John Horton Conway, a mathematician. I discovered him while looking for a project to code in my boredom.
It operates on 4 simple rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The results of this are staggering; you will see beautiful shapes and civilizations form but ultimately perish for extending beyond their needs, while small, common ones
will exist for eternity without outside interference.
The most common shapes are below, but there are hundreds of unique shapes that are not shown.
